How might we utilize Infomercial design tools to gather research on various demographics?

“$19.95”

The word “Iconic” well-describes the blue screens decorating the ending seconds of countless infomercials, all hawking forgettable tchotchkes for always-affordable prices. These distinctly American T.V. experiences, despite their endless product differentiations, maintain consistent experiential patterns that instantly betray their intent, for better or worse.

I believe the phrase, ["I know it when I see it."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) applies here.

What’s contributed to the aesthetic similarity between most informercials? Is it an issue of pacing? Are mass-purchased video templates to blame? Have commercial regulations anything to do with it? Is informercial media culture subject to the same tropes and clichés other media is subject to? Why yellow texts and blue backgrounds? Why the persistence in utilizing the $XX.95 pricing scheme?

Infomercial 'experience texture’ could potentially be rooted in some of these tropes, all of them, or none — that is uncertain. What is certain however — the experience of choosing to watch an infomercial is typically awkwardly satirical at best, cringe-inducing and insta-channel-switching at worst.

What could be done to keep the amateur *Spirit of the Infomercial* alive while facilitating a better end-viewer experience?

In this Intervention, we conceptualize a means for 'any given amateur-videographer retailer/entrepreneur’ to (co)create a well-designed infomercial experience utilizing simple tools that allow 'trickle-down user experience design’ to flourish.
